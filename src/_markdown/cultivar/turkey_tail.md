Turkey Tail mushrooms are a type of medicinal mushroom that have been used in traditional Chinese medicine and other traditional medicine systems for centuries. They are known for their immune-boosting properties and have been used to treat a variety of health conditions, including cancer, diabetes, and viral infections.

The mushroom's active compounds include polysaccharides, such as beta-glucans, which are believed to stimulate the immune system. They also contain antioxidants and other beneficial compounds. Turkey Tail mushrooms can be consumed in supplement form, as a tea, or as a powder that can be added to food or drinks.

It's important to note that turkey tail mushrooms are not recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women and that they can interact with certain medications such as blood thinners, immunosuppressive drugs and blood sugar lowering drugs.
